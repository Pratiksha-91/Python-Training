python -
	Python is a high-level,sensitive, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. 
	Python is widely used for various purposes including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, 
	scientific computing, automation, and more.

	1]Interpreted and Interactive: 
		Python is an interpreted language, which means that code is
		executed line by line by an interpreter, rather than compiled into machine code before execution.
        	This allows for rapid development and testing through interactive sessions and scripting.

	2]Cross-platform:
		 Python is platform-independent, meaning it runs on various operating systems
       		 including Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it versatile for development across different environments.		

	3]Support for Multiple Programming Paradigms: 
		Python supports multiple programming paradigms including procedural, object-oriented, and 
		functional programming, allowing developers to choose the approach that best fits their needs.

Procedural Programming:

Definition: 
	Procedural programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of procedures or routines, 
	which are sequences of instructions that perform a specific task. 
 	Programs in procedural languages are typically composed of procedures that manipulate data.

Key Characteristics:

1]Focuses on procedures or routines.
2]Emphasizes the use of functions or procedures to structure code.
3]Data is often manipulated using variables and passed as arguments to functions.
4]Example languages: C

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int num1, num2, sum;
    printf("Enter the first number: ");
    scanf("%d", &num1);
    printf("Enter the second number: ");
    scanf("%d", &num2); sum = num1 + num2;
    printf("The sum of %d and %d is: %d\n", num1, num2, sum);

    return 0;
}


Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):

Definition:
	Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," 
	which are instances of classes that encapsulate data and behavior. 
	Programs in OOP languages are structured around objects that interact with each other.

Key Characteristics:

1]Focuses on objects, which combine data (attributes) and behavior (methods).
2]Encapsulation: Objects encapsulate data and behavior, hiding internal implementation details.
3]Inheritance: Objects can inherit attributes and behavior from parent classes, promoting code reuse and modularity.
4]Polymorphism: Objects can be treated as instances of their parent classes, allowing for flexibility and extensibility.
Example languages: Java, Python, C++,C#.

using System;

class Circle
{
    private double radius;
   
    public Circle(double radius)
    {
        this.radius = radius;
    }
    public double CalculateArea()
    {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Circle myCircle = new Circle(5.0);

        Console.WriteLine("Area of the circle: {0}", myCircle.CalculateArea());
    }
}



Identation-



Random Number
 	Python does not have a random() function to make a random number, but Python has a built-in module 
	called random that can be used to make random numbers:

		import randome
		print(random.randrange(1,10))
